# Portfolio App Rules

This directory contains the coding, organizational, and collaboration rules for this personal portfolio/profile web application project. These rules are designed to ensure code consistency, accessibility, high quality, and clarity for both human and AI contributors.

## Rule Files

- **programmer-profile.md**: Documents the experience level for key technologies and dictates how detailed explanations and comments should be for this project.
- **app-requirements.md**: Lists all expected features and requirements; the source of truth for project scope.
- **naming-conventions.md**: Defines naming standards for models, variables, components, files, and folders (for Vue 3, TypeScript, Less).
- **stack-specific-rules.md**: Provides guidance for all tech stack code in this repo (Vue 3, script setup, TS, Less, optional Pinia, accessibility, and responsive practices).
- **project-structure.md**: Explains the actual file and folder layout; shows where all important files and assets go.
- **personal-profile.md**: Provides important context for interacting with the project owner and supporting productive work (energy, focus, communication preferences).

## Getting Started
1. Read `app-requirements.md` to understand the project’s goals and features.
2. See `project-structure.md` to learn where files should be placed.
3. Review `naming-conventions.md` and `stack-specific-rules.md` to write consistent, valid, and accessible code.
4. Use `programmer-profile.md` to calibrate explanation and comment detail.
