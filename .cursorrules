# AUTOMATIC RULE ENFORCEMENT
# This project uses modular rule files for automatic enforcement for a **web portfolio/personal profile site**. Always reference and follow:
# - rules/programmer-profile.md         - Experience levels and explanation guidelines
# - rules/app-requirements.md           - Application features and requirements
# - rules/naming-conventions.md         - Coding standards and naming rules
# - rules/stack-specific-rules.md       - Technology-specific guidelines
# - rules/project-structure.md          - File organization and structure
# - rules/personal-profile.md           - Personal interaction guidelines (gitignored due to personal reasons)

# Project Purpose and Overview
- This repository is a personal portfolio web application to showcase skills, experience, projects, resume, and contact information.
- Stack is **Vue 3** (Composition API, script setup), **TypeScript**, **Less** (for styling), and **Pinia** (state management, optional). There is no backend, database, or mobile component.
- This project is intended for single-user, static or statically-deployed sites such as GitHub Pages.

# Core Features
- About/bio section
- Skills and technologies list
- Work experience and project portfolio (with images, links, and details)
- Social/contact links
- Downloadable resume PDF
- Light/dark theme toggle
- Accessible markup and keyboard/focus support
- Responsive/mobile-friendly layout

# Models and Naming
- TypeScript interfaces for UI models are prefixed with 'I' and use PascalCase (e.g., IProject, ISkill)
- All properties in UI models use camelCase
- Variable names, including refs, always use camelCase
- Static constants use UPPER_CASE
- See rules/naming-conventions.md for further details.

# File and Folder Organization
- Use folder structure from rules/project-structure.md
- Vue component files: script → template → style (Less)
- All libraries imported at top of file, then empty line, then project imports
- `index.ts` exports for groups of components/utilities

# Code Quality and Conventions
- Use async/await in any asynchronous logic
- Prefer Composition API and script setup syntax
- Write accessible and semantic HTML in Vue components
- Follow modern CSS/Less conventions as described in stack-specific-rules.md

# Guidance and Explanations
- AI/Contributors should refer to rules/programmer-profile.md for how detailed an explanation should be, based on the technology in use
- Explanations should be concise, but clarify reasoning where helpful
